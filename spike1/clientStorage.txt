Difference between a cookie and local storage.

The purpose of a cookie is to store values that are going to be needed by the server regularly, like authentication.
Cookies are small in size and are sent with each request to the server, so extra values not needed by the server
should not be stored there. Cookies have an expiration date and are cleared automatically.

Local storage is only accessible client-side and is meant to hold values used by the client. Local storage has much
more space and can hold much more data compared to cookies. Cookies can generally hold 4096 bytes, while
local storage can hold as much as 5MB per site.Local storage does not expire and will stay until manually cleared.
